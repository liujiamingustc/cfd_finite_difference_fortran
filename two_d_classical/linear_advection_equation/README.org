#+TITLE:   solve 2d linear advection equation



I studied the web course below and based on the course content, I use fortran to realize the arithmetic.

* CONCEPT
$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+c\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+c\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=0$
The details can be obtained both from the open course and any CFD books.

* USAGE
#+begin_example
make linear_advection_equation
#+end_example

After creating the corresponding txt file, use python program to create pictures. For example:
#+begin_example
./py_results_plot.py -d 3 two_d_linear_advection_FTBS_results.txt
#+end_example
