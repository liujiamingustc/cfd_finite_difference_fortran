* CONCEPT
$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=0$
The details can be obtained both from the open course and any CFD books.

* USAGE
#+begin_example
make one_d_advt_burgers_FTBS
#+end_example

After creating the corresponding txt file, use python program to create pictures. For example:
#+begin_example
./py_results_plot.py one_d_advt_burgers_FTBS_results.txt
#+end_example
