#+TITLE: FORTRAN practice for the Fluid mechanics



In my spare time, I studied the web course below and based on the course content, I use FORTRAN to realize the arithmetic. It is also a way to improve my FORTRAN skills. Welcome the corrections.

* CONCEPT
The only thing is to solve the Navier-Stokes equations.
$\frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t}+(\vec{v}\cdot\nabla)\vec{v}=-\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2\vec{v}$
The details can be obtained both from the open course and any CFD books.

* USAGE
See each folder's README.org
